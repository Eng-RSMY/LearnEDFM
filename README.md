# LearnEDFM
A numerical code to solve flow and transport in fractured porous media by the embedded discrete fracture method

What is LearnEDFM?
------------------

LearnEDFM is a MATLAb program solving flow and transport in fractured porous media using the embedded discrete fracture method. It is targeted at researchers in the field of subsurface simulations who want to understand and apply the embedded discrete fracture model.

For the impatient:
------------------

Let's say you've unpacked the .tar.gz file into a directory /path/to/LearnEDFM. 
Then you can run and test the program by opening matlab and running:

    $ cd /path/to/LearnEDFM
    $ cd examples/
    $ ex1

To build from the repository, execute the following commands first:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dealii/dealii

Then start MATLAB and continue as before.
